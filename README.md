## Projects
1. PDF Query Tool

   I led the development of an AI-powered application that enables query-based searching across multiple PDF documents. This project was part of my Computer Science master's program at Grand Valley State University. Utilizing Python, the application leverage librariries like Langchain and Huggingface to generate precise and contextually relevant responses. Through this project I have sharpened my Python skills, deepened my understanding of AI, and had hands-on experience with key technical libraries in the AI world.
